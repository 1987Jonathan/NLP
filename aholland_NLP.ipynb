We expect \"Little Women\" to exhibit a higher frequency of feminine pronouns, while \"Moby-Dick\" will have a higher frequency of masculine pronouns. The mid-1850s is a relevant period because it provides a historical context where gender roles and biases were more pronounced in literature while the \"gender\" representation in writing was still roughly balanced (40% women to 60% men).\n",

        "**Hypothesis 2: Gender Narration Perspective Impacts Pronoun Usage**\n",

        "One interesting finding is the lack of masculine object pronouns in all three works. Masculine object pronouns include \"him\" and \"his\" (when used as objects). This absence might reflect the narrative styles and thematic focuses of the authors, as well as the societal norms of the mid-1800s that influenced their writing.\n",

        "\n",
        "These findings show how gender and narrative perspective influenced writing in the mid-1800s. \"Moby-Dick\" by Herman Melville, with its higher use of masculine pronouns, reflects a male-centric view typical of that era. Louisa May Alcott's \"Little Women\" and \"Little Men,\" on the other hand, show a more balanced use of feminine and masculine pronouns, highlighting female experiences even while addressing male perspectives in \"Little Men.\"\n",

        "This analysis helps us understand the historical context of gender representation in literature. The significant differences in pronoun usage reveal how authors' gender and societal norms shaped their writing. These insights are valuable for today's discussions about gender bias in media and literature, showing how historical gender roles have influenced language and storytelling.\n",
